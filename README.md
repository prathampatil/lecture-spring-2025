## Description
This repository contains a code to plot the XY data from the file ```data.txt``` contained in the repository itself. ```data.txt``` is a file containing XY data of the spectroscopic measurements from the Low Energy Ion Scattering Spectroscopy(LEIS). 

This data can sometimes be noisy, so if needed, it can be cleaned by setting ```dclean = 1```. The default stays ```dclean = 0```

The ```LEIS_plot.py``` file contains plotting instructions for the plot to be readily presentable.

## Installation
Install all the dependancies and download the code file ```LEIS_plot.py``` and the data file ```data.txt``` 

## Usage
Change the path for the data file and the code used to import the data file to plot it for yourself.

## Contributing
Please create a pull request before commiting as this is a code I actively use.
